# VDDOS / Sensor Plugin - https://vddos.voduy.com

Checks connections as tcp and automatically runs robot verification when there is a specific connection. (JavaScript verification remains active when there is no attack, and advanced robot verification is activated if an attack is detected to prevent simple attacks. You can do it in another equation by compiling the golang code yourself. (for example: like no to high..)) Default code state: high+ to captcha+
